====== 15. Perception Filter ======
Created Thursday 18 February 2021

=== Motivation ===
* Foolish/gullible people do exist.
* People with malice do exist.
* Consequently, false beliefs and false facts do exist.

=== Context ===
* I lost confidence as a 16 yr old, even though I was pretty good at studies, enjoyed sports and had lots of hobbies. This was because some stupid people wanted to sell their ideas, for which they made me believe that my conscience was bad.
* At 23, I realized I made a huge mistake by listening to these people. So I'm collecting data and making this algorithm.
* I learnt during this period that people are being gullible and malice are not necessarily disjoint properties. 
* But it is impossible for me to live while hating people, it is just a lot of cognitive load. So I made the algorithm, i.e I mechanized the process of detachment by delegating the task of staying away from them using this algorithm.
* This way, I'll train myself to forget their ideas while still being happy. **I want to keep my good intentions intact.**

=== What is this ===
* This is a perception filter, it will:
	1. Block false information - factually false.
	2. Block difficult to test wrong information - like ability, freedom and other things I acquired due to my cultural capital.
	3. It will filter dangerous facts - incomplete knowledge.

=== Pros of the device ===
* It will clear out false facts.
* It will clear out demotivating facts which are sold as 'hard truths'.
* It will preserve the base of inflexible knowledge, which can be converted to deep and efficient structures.
* It will help in decision making.
* It will help in retaining the ideals learnt at school.

=== Cons of the device ===
* It can filter out potentially useful information. i.e false negatives.
* It can stagnate memory with false positives.
* It can create dogmatic beliefs.
* It can decrease empathy, due to loss of communication.

=== How do make the filter amenable ===
* Curiosity will handle most of the communication loss.
* Greed will handle most of the 'hard truths'. e.g I want to be rich **and** morally sound.
* Empathy can help solve dogmatic beliefs and intolerance.
* A good filter will reject most false beliefs because of the acquired level of correct facts. This will make the filter better.

=== Algorithm ===
* Gather information which is likely to match the 'Life Plan'.
Steps:
	1. Run a basic syntax scan for spelling mistakes and other stuff ‚Üí The person speaking here may use wrong grammar, even if he/she knows what they are talking about. This information can be ignored fully, because the information is prone to be ambiguous.
	2. Run basic semantic check for malice - find out keywords that suggest that the conveyer is trying to fool the audience. If malice is discovered, continue only if the information is likely to affect the real world within a significant time and produce big effects.
		a. It may use words like "us", "they" or "your" for established protocols and facts.
		b. Chuck out information from unscientific/populist sources. This is because the people are less likely have judgemental skills.
		c. Chuck out any information which discourages freedom and inquiry, irrespective of the followers of the source.
If the information seems to be correct, but the conveyer doesn't provide proof, it can rejected without proof. You may try to prove the thing if it is interesting.

=== FLGü§£Ô∏è ===
* Writing shows you have a less powerful mind then others. If this is false, then I'm correct. If this is wrong, I can do two things:
	* Keep writing because I won't progress in this area. This is very unlikely.
	* Make my brain powerful: Writing will reveal where thinking can be optimized, and I'll implement it.
	* It is supported by research. Humans are forgetful.
	**So keep writing!**
