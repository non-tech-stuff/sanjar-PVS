# 46. Self before all else
Created Saturday 08 May 2021

#### Context
I was reading about Sharia on a website(just for fun, and was happy) having exit-door for Muslims.
For a second, I succumed to the rule, and found myself accepting death. This caused a lot of trouble. I looked up in my values, and found no sense of self preservation.
So I thought of adding this value.

#### Why
Primarily because rules are nothing to a dead person.
And a person who deprecates himself(worst case accepts injustice) loses out on a definition of happiness.

* Rigorously speaking, a person who loses out on happiness cannot make others happy. Consequently, behavior(self or others) is hampered.

* I want everyone to have their self as priority - this makes us be the best to others and save us from stupid myths.


#### How
Just remember that you are the most important person, and that you make decisions. Maybe, for some cause, I'm ready to die, but it'll be a deliberate decision, not something done out of fear/helplessness/stupidity.

* [DPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_personality_disorder) and [33. Personal Boundaries](./33._Personal_Boundaries.md). Context: I resolved to not listen to clerics, because it was just too inefficient and painful to ask for everything. I also got very angry about people asking clerics 'is this OK', I was like WTF, just explore. There's no need to ask anyone. Learnability/DIY is the key.
* This will also save me from being too 'nice', which is just dishonesty. Dishonesty is always bad, especially to the self. Being nice should be emergent, not the starting point. See [37. Ban Hesitation](./37._Ban_Hesitation.md)


#### Conclusion
Self is the most important thing. Preserve it no matter what.
