##### Overcoming biases
I've come across many disciplines which are amazing, and useful. But I have been haunted by wrong things too, which are false and useless it seems. I should be more specific:

1. Thinking - is thinking useful, seems like a wrong question. How much should one think? - I've discussed this [here](../19._Thinking_and_practicality.md).
2. Knowledge and curiosity - should I be curious about everything. Wouldn't this "fill" my brain and distract from doing meaningful things. This may be true, but I'm too stubborn to stop being curious. I think this was positively programmed in me by school, by books, by history, by people and my experiences. I think everybody(including non-humans) has this, it's vital for an IGUS, although I don't like to think this way - the journey is so much beautiful than the destination.
3. Math - is it useful. Well I am interested in somewhat solvable problems. I leave the hard ones - this is not a good thing. I short circuited math to obvious things, thinking no solution can come out. Wrong - a child learns by playing, in fact it is the best way. Our minds can grow! Moreover, Immanuel Kant broke Hume's fork.
4. Science - this one was tricky to justify back in the 1600s, but it revolutionised us as a species, forever. Knowing the universe around us is so good, and its has a happy correlation with development. I love my world. I can pursue my passion and it leads us to becoome better.
5. Literature - especially fiction. I though this was useless, because I had been fooled by many people who can't differentiate between fiction and reality. But it is a great way to think and present things. Sure, we can make mistakes, even be fooled, or become perpetrators ourselves.
6. Drama/Cinema/Music - I was passed on a prejudice about this. I was told this was bad and risky. This is complete nonsense - it's like saying no to food.
7. Being happy - I have seen some people hypothesize that happiness and success are a zero-sum game. I hate this, and am too stubborn to make a compromise between these. Now, in the real world, there's a high correlation between happiness, honesty and skill in people. Being happy will *result* in better products, decisions, and improve the overall quaility of life.


##### Realizing that we make "knowledge"

* I was accustomed to obeying commands from parents. I was programmed to think it *is* "right", and will be. Being independent was something of a taboo. I got over this because I was stubborn and alone.
* Similarly, people making rules for themselves seemed risky. I got kicked in the ass by religion and realized I'm the best person for myself. I learnt about democracy and learnt that it was not only pratical, it was needed very badly.


#### Why do this?
I have the following fears:

1. Tech and math won't work out. - Irrational
2. I deem things as useless - like critical thinking, social science, which is my default thinking mode. This really causes a lot of discomfort - because the effects on the real world are so amazing.
3. I will not be able to make a living - this destroys my curiosity and intellectual playfullness. Makes the thing boring.
4. What I do is not exiting/disruptive - this a good criteria, but is shouldn't be external. I understand I am being foolish - things like math, science, computer science, AI were done at a time when computers were absent or not that powerful. But we had confidence - we even used human computers to do stuff. I refuse to believe that only a handful of people can recognize the importance these fields. This would be utterly wasteful and boring, in fact depressing.
