====== 33. False guilt ======
Created Tuesday 20 April 2021

TODO: I think both rationally and emotionally. But in some cases, thinking about other people makes me feel **guilty**. i.e. will it be bad for people. So how should I organize facts and my love for people such that:
1. I am happy
2. I think quickly
3. I think reliably

In other words, I seem to be dependent on people. I think this is a destructive mindset.

=== Proposed ===
Distill the world into "knowledge" and just "myself".

=== Does this work? ===
Let's observe.
Pros:
1. Ambition
2. Drive - will power, courage, self-efficacy
3. Empathy - and consequently, equality
4. Communication with people
5. Rigor in thinking - decreases wishful thinking
6. Hate minimization - populist agendas are trashed
7. Negative bias for others and consequent demotivation(assuming it //is// normal).

Cons:
Nothing that I can think of.
Well initially I had the problem of evil, but is resolved on observation(data).

=== In the real world ===
So I fit many historical events to get a good view:
1. Science, innovation("let's search for a better way") and being curious.
2. Groupism/Populism - innovation that is passed by the group as "OK".
3. Authoritarian regimes - innovation is arbitrary
4. Modern democracies - you're free.

Thinks like science, literature, fashion, connection are impossible if we are chained(dependent) on other people.

=== Conclusion ===
To be independent and innovate without fear, Assume that the world is made of two things only:
1. Knowledge
2. Me - I want to be happy, without any compromise.

Note: Hypocrisy is not allowed.
