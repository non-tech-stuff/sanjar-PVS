# 37. Ban Hesitation
Created Friday 23 April 2021

FIXME: hestitation.

#### Never hesitate to be passionate, fun, insightful
It is very important that I be passionate and happy as I feel. Supressing passion is like a giving up on a wonderful opportunity. The passion may be love, affection, understanding of a concept, an idea or any such thing. Sanjar, you need to make sure that you're always passionate, and not hesitant(tired). This will lead to a lovely, active and successful life. You shouldn't think about how others feel, and assume that they'll be OK. This is an assumption of happiness from the recieving person/crowd, and that the act of passion is good. Hesitation will only kill passion and confidence in all aspects of life, just imagine personal life. It is too safe.

FIXME: vulnerability.

#### Don't try to be serious(or care about people's opinions) - only care about facts and values
FIXME: the effects of disorientation made me very judgemental. I started staying away from all news sources, even comical effects of it. As I know, difficult issues cannot be solved with a serious mindset. Due to my cutting down on 'sources', I caused a major loss of social connection.

* I should connect with people I like, without regard to what someone says.
* I should not look for acceptability(from the society). This is very hyprocritical of me.
* I found myself caring what people might think, what effect a comical thing will have. The truth is that humor helps in thinking. Einstein hated humorlessness, cause it makes things difficult.
* Being serious is foolish, the mind cannot think properly due to stress.
* Being with good people teaches things are possible. Stress can be handled.
* Teaches us to see beyond words, accents etc.
* Reinforces - [33. Personal Boundaries](./33._Personal_Boundaries.md)

Note: Don't stay on a negative tone though, be aware of your emotional state. Disorientation kills.
TODO: I've found that I get negatively stimulated, against accepted values. I recalculate them. I need to see how I deploy my value model in real time. Can't process value models on the fly. Instagram can help with this. Rigor must be retained, I'd like to believe that humor and rigor go together. fear of failure kills humor. Discovery: Learning values and following them seem to be different. I'll learn it. Also, people are independent.

#### Vulnerability

* This is already the F part in HRF.

Vulnerability(i.e being yourself without fear of others) can be seen as a part of hesitation. I must remember that failing so many time made me like this, but it was something I always wanted. Being deliberate of not hiding emotions and desires from others.
Examples of being vulnerable:

1. Asking someone on a date openly
2. Not being afraid to offend someone, assuming you are not being an ass.
3. Admit what you lack.
4. Take responsibility
5. Tell people they are being hurtful
6. Tell people you admire/respect/love them.


Note:

* Vulnerability is not a tactic for some goal, it is for your own self. It is genuine, it has the why in it.
* Vulnerability is not emotional vomit. It is just not a happy thing.
