====== 26. Ambition ======
Created Monday 05 April 2021

=== Context ===
* I was reading about pack-files from https://www.kernel.org. It suddenly occurred to me that Linux, was made by volunteers who wanted to use and make //free// software.
* //"But things not made by corporations **would** be very low quality and not stress tested."// - **my flawed reasoning.**
* Reality - But Linux is used around the world - in embedded devices, servers, clusters, supercomputers - all of which are "crirtical" systems.

=== Toxic Assumptions ===
This "thinking" exposed a lot of toxic assumptions in me:
1. **Normal people can't make good software** - This is really stupid of me. [[https://youtu.be/IIDLcaQVMqw|There are no "miracle" people]]. Corporations exist because of people, not the other way around.
2. **Free software is small and meant for personal use, not for enterprise** - I don't know why I had this idea. Maybe, because I was never //ambitious// enough to make large systems, because of low confidence. Examples of large scale free software - Linux, Apache Hadoop, Apache Lucene, NginX, see more [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apache_Software_Foundation_projects|Apache Projects]]. Read [[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/|The Cathedral and the Bazaar, by Eric Raymond]].
3. **Free software is not efficient** - this is another lie. If the programmers are the same, the software will be the same. In fact, Free software is better because the programmer //wants// to solve the problem.
4. **Free software is slow to make** - this one is true in a way, but reality is different. Linux is more "social" then it is "technical", In fact, Linux was not "designed", it "evolved". Read the Design part of the Wikipedia Page. Here's a picture.

5. **There's less** **focus(Fear of forking)** - Yes, this is a splitting of a community, and is a nice to have option. [[./Paper 21 - Forks impacts and motivations in free and open source projects.pdf|See this]]

=== What to do now? ===
Well, it would be great if we can simply remove such thoughts. The simplest criteria in place is using the O clause of the [[24. HRO - three params|HRO]]. It increases learning in a good way.

=== Ambition - how is this related? ===
Well the whole problem is simply - non-participation. It can be due to low confidence, fear, social imposition of ideas. Not being ambitious leads to non-participation, which is simply a recipie for poverty and pain. Simply said, ambition is a necessity for success in anything.

=== Advantages of being ambitious ===
* Innovation
* Happiness
* Accountability by the user, customer, reciever.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Nothing actually, assuming you're not hypocritical.

=== Conclusion ===
* Think big, no matter what.
* Avoid non-participation in anything, mentally or otherwise. 
* You don't have to participate, but know that the option is always open.
* Keep learning.
