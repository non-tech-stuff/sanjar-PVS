====== 5. Falsifying the mind-body zero sum theory ======
Created Wednesday 03 February 2021

Q. If I start working out more, I'll lose my ability to think and study, or vice-versa.
R. This is a difficult question to answer, because we don't know where to begin. So let's try some theories:
	* It is true: But data suggests otherwise, many scientists have been athletes and have said that sports actually helped them.
	* If is false: The mind is actually a part of the body, and it has its specialized function. 
		1. The brain controls all the functions of the body, and also controls the growth, since it has to regulate waste as well as food to different parts. This can easily be observed in case of lactic acid formation, clot on injuries: the brain redirects resources to affected parts of the body, to keep the well. Thinking on the other hand, happens due to brain cells. These cells are specialized and precious. Also the brain is very small and intricate as compared to the body, so transfer of cells from the brain ‚Üí body is impractical, and very dangerous because brain cell growth itself requires lots of resources. Another reason is that the probability of loss of organs(not the brain) is higher than the loss of the head itself, so it makes little sense for the body to use up brain cells in exchange for organs. **Moreover, such a situation(brain ‚Üí body) will only occur due very extreme malnutrition.**
		2. The body may not change cells, but it can change the resource for the body and the brain. **This** certainly does happen. If someone only exercises but does not study, then his brain will note develop after a certain limit. But exercising the brain has no effect on body growth if proper nutrition is provided for both.
		3. If the person takes care of nutrition and guards against injury, then both the brain and the body will be nourished. Will the resources be equally distributed? Well I don't have an idea. But the body will stay hungry if its demands are not met. If someone has ample resources and exercises, the body is stressed and the brain is not, channelling more resources to the body. This way the body becomes strong without any loss of brain cells or other physiological effects.
		4. Another explanation can be that growth is an **involuntary** action that is not controlled consciously by humans. It surely can be mimicked, via exercise, but it still remains involuntary. So, no voluntary power is used for body growth and a surplus of nutrition will ensure that the very unlikely exchange of cells(brain ‚Üí body) will ever take place. This is a very good argument for the **independence of the brain and body**, provided surplus nutrition is being provided.
		* In a worst case scenario, i.e. even if nutrition and other resources are severely limited, it is very very unlikely that the **brain cell ‚Üí body cell** transfer will ever take place, there are huge disadvantages:
			1. **Limited survival time** - the body will be at the mercy of the environment's decay rate which depends on factors like predators, weather, radiation, micro-organisms, diseases etc.
			2. **Better brain is more important** - A better brain can increase chances of survival(i.e finding resources) by a huge amount. It can save us from predators, from radiation and disease through technology. Also, fat and muscle loss are reversible processes, so they are not a life threatening huge loss.
		* A better body will result in the minimization of diseases and other factors(like predators). After the body has reached a goal where stress to the body is normalized.
		* Brain and body development is more likely to be asynchronous, instead of the being sequential.

=== Conclusion ===
* The theories put forward strongly suggest the absence of negative impacts of brain and the body on each other under all circumstances. It's not a zero sum game.
* Brain and body **do** impact each other, but only positively, assuming there is sufficient nutrition and exercise: growth is asynchronous.
* A powerful brain and body

=== Negatives of the theory ===
I cannot see any, yet.

=== Positives of the theory ===
* A lot of exercise can help the brain and body grow and complement each other: due to asynchronous nature of growth.
* A good body qualifies the person to live longer and live adventurously(who doesn't want that).
* A good body increases chances of finding a mate, this is very important it seems: because humans in general prefer stronger mates, but this is mostly voluntary(arbitrary). This is a incredible **win-win** scenarios.
* It's a good way to focus and increase confidence: you take care of yourself.

FIXME: Add this

=== Context - managing thinking and happiness(using exercise) ===
FIXME: Maybe this is OK. I'm panicking. I don't think this is unrelated to [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302204459.htm|takotsubo syndrome]].
* I was in one of my thinking sessions. I learnt a lot. I became so happy and excited that my heart rate went up, I had a very very minor pain(nothing sudden, it came and went gradually). I looked up online and found that people can die of happiness.
* Now, happily speaking, I cannot be sad just for my heart. This is not something that I can do. That will be stupid.
* Steps to be happy all the time, I think:
	* Exercise heavily, this will make the heart healthy
	* Do lots of work
	* Solve difficult problems - finicky ones. FIXME: this seems like a good idea
	* Solve very stupid issues - which I cringe and blame for a loss of mood. Things like analyzing violent behaviors, news. FIXME: this can be a very stupid idea
	* Take regular breaks, for water or food
	Keep doing this till I can sleep. I only have to do it for 24 - sleep_time
	* Best thing is to exercise, directly manages the heart rate. **This solves the problem, I am so happy learning this üòÅÔ∏è.** This way I can control my optimize my happiness and control it at will, without the risk of heart disease.
	Then reset.
* Being sad is not an option, and should never be.
Note: What's the limit to this? Am I reacting too soon. Be happy, don't be stupid. Don't succumb to stupid falsehoods. Try to make a win-win situation out of this. Don't let go of anything, be greedy.
Elon Musk says working too much is not as good as it sounds, does it mean things are inherently sad. Don't listen to him. Just do it.

=== What to do ===
* Don't leave any opportunity for fitness activities. 
* Remember the adventurism, longevity, pairing criteria.
* Make fitness like food, it is mandatory.
