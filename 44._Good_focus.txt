====== 44. Good focus ======
Created Thursday 06 May 2021

TODO: I have come across a huge number of topics while learning/unlearning Islam. But this is not totally good, I don't want to be a polemic. I want to explore and create things. I should switch focus to real problems, my wishes, concepts and get rid of polemic mindset. It makes me a bad person, and its not a good thing.
