FIXME - always ask why, how and other questions. It's the best way to learn. You are happy and honest. Without the why, everything's boring, and there's no learning.
* Own your way of thinking, because it is who you are. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_womFWYueQk
* Keep asking questions, and be comfortable.
* Be brave, failure is OK. Learn and move.
* Your degree and grades don't define you, or your future. We can grow.
* This also helps in collaboration and bonding.
