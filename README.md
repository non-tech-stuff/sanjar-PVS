These are my questions and answers(thought process), as I navigate life.

They can be about anything, but are not super specific.

Examples:

1. Thinking
2. Behavior
3. Social Equality
4. My perception filters

Some things sound like rants, but trust me, I don't won't write if I'm angry or disoriented.
