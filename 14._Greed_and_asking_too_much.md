# 14. Greed and asking too much
Created Tuesday 16 February 2021

#### Greed
**Greed** â†’ This is one of the most important human qualities, which is severely underrated. Greed, according to me refers to the incessant thirst for something - it may be money, knowledge, fame etc. 

* There's no problem with greed if its legal.
* Greed is the pinnacle of desire, the quality which creates **drive** in us to pursue great things.
* Yes, greed is incessant.


#### Asking too much?

* I was into science, social science, math, English ... just about every course offered at school. I was very interested in learning about science and controlling(in a good way) nature to my advantage. This was my fantasy as a kid. Learning physics meant I could control physical structures/bodies, and chemistry meant controlling substances. I believed that science was the solution to all problems and was my passion at the same time.
* I was accumulating some false advise all this time. These advice(s) suggested that I was asking too much. But what is too much or too less. This is only defined by the most greedy person in the group, because everyone tries to be him/her. We'll ignore if this is possible for all members: many come near the most wealthiest(in knowledge etc) and it becomes the standard. Then the next generation comes and the world changes, the definition has to change.
* All in all, the most driven person of the current generation will pave the way for 'normal' things in the future.
* Different people have different goals and ambitions, and so the amount of resources they need may vary. In fact, acceptance of this simple thing leads to the concept of freedom. Anyone should be able to build his/her company or business, however big or small, as they wish, without need for justifcation, as far as its legal.
* Take an example - I was wary of predicting(future) things, because predicting stuff was considered bad in my culture. What they wanted to emphasize was that nobody can predict future by reading hands or other stupid stuff. But they(my group members) went crazy and took away the freedom to predict by anyway. But they were fools, we can in fact predict a hell lot of things, this is because nature seems to be mostly repeatable(a small holde at the Quantum scale though). But the caveat at the quantum scale is a fundamental impossibility, which can help in quantum computer and security.
* Also such stupid and rigid rules assume the impossiblity of virtual worlds, where we design most things. The possibility of this is the starting point for simulators(and simulations), open-world video games and stuff like terraforming.
* Considering all the false negatives, I became uninterested and started thinking about other things. I believe one of the goals of education is to show how great stuff is possible, and to create a healthy attitude against impossibility.
* I had lost this attitude, which is just hope. Now, hopeless and pessimist people never win. I was not even exited when I learnt how to control computers, AI or other cutting-edge tech.
* This thinking is wrong, even statistically.
* One more important discovery: I have exploited the fact that because humans can think, hear and undertstand language, we might be able to create machines that can do the same, by undertstanding simple rules by which we run. This is a very good thought, but it is not necessary for the machine to be human/natural. The Wright brothers made the first functional "heavier than air" airplane, which looked nothing like the bird. They actually studied birds and how their wings interacted with air. This is also reachable from the first-principles thinking approach of physics.
* Now, I want to be comfortable in exploiting everything as long as it does not encroach the freedom of others, which is the countries law.
* Moroever, I am very happy with most laws of this era and the freedoms are very dear to me. This means I can probabilistically agree with my preliminary examinations of good/bad.


#### Unhealthy gratefulness

* Some people around me thought I was going too fast, and such things are not good. These people were either my worst enemies or were very stupid. Either way I must ignore them.
* They said my exploitative behavior was a sign of my ungratefulness. I am still unable to explain this axiomatically, but it seems to be a very bad and stupid idea.
* Some ideas of these kinds are:
	1. Our ancestors had many problems, and we have less of them, so we should be content with what we have. **Answer**: Personally I think this idea is the starting point of poverty, both of materially and of joy.
	2. You need to justify your exploitative behavior, as thinking about boundless innovation is actually like cancer. **Answer**: I cannot justify this, at least from first-principles. I think asking justification for this is like asking someone to prove that they deserve to exist. This is just plain BS. Nobody should ever be asked to do this, this is one of the most fundamental rights of any sentient being. And living things live, and not just survive.
* I think this idea neglects the fact that we are being ungrateful if don't use our brains or work on what we desire.


#### Pessimism fuels inaction

* Due to the above facts, it was easier(I'm human) for me to assume that computers will fail to scale, will never be realistically so big to simulate natural processes or games.
* And I'm happy that I was wrong.
* Doing engineering is very difficult in of itself. And pessimism further stops innovation.


#### Pessimism leads to demotivation

* I studied chemisty thinking I would be able to know and interact with matter intelligently.
* I loved things like the periodic table, which in addition to being a helpful too, was evidence to the fact that it is possible to exhaustively list all the basic building blocks of matter.
* Facts like this made me brave, motivated and ready to explore the world.
* The pessimism lead me to believe that such feeling of joy were false positives and we had not conquered nature(at least chemically). This is true because science is a dynamic thing.
* But I like(for psychological reasons) to think that its like a picture that is getting clearer with each theory.
* There have been paradigm shifts, for example particle-wave-dual nature of light. But it has increased our understanding anyway, and that undertstanding was very useful.
* I want to be brave and fearless.


#### Greedy people make life possible

* This is true, greedy people want money/knowledge/somethingElse. If they do it legally, they drive humanity forward(life becomes good). People are employed and are happy. This also means economic development. Any businessperson who has any brains will take care of his/her employees.
* Generally, I don't like to justify my desires by using paranoid reasons. But it is true that if there are no greedy people, the economy will fail and we'll stop innovating, waiting to be extinct when the next asteroid hits, the next earthquake, climate change or an increase in population(which is good, assuming we are able to become interplanetary, or become technologically advanced).
* So I think greed is a win-win situation, let's celebrate it.


#### Conclusion

* I'll remain exploitative in a civil way.
* I'll be fearless and brave.
* I'll study and have a passion for science and technology.
* I'll create and nurture a filter that throws out stupid ideas, because life is very precious.
* I'll shun old irrational fears like control, future prediction, biotechnology and so on. It is important for me to keep an open mind to focus on things that really matter and doing so will help in identifying actual threats, if any.
