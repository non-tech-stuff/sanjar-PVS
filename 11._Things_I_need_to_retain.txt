====== 11. Things I need to retain ======
Created Tuesday 09 February 2021

Need to discuss societal, intellectual and other deep concepts
FIXME
1. Not being judgemental.
2. Loving the people around me.
3. Respecting people's choices.
4. Calm thinking - not defending a side and being doubtful. I can support a side, if I have data.
5. Avoid obscurity - arbitary conditions. Use HRF only.
6. Having an appreciation in thinking as done in a liberal arts education programme. Open, rigorous and frank. With a happy ignorance for 'uses', at least initially. Corresponds with [[30. Celebrate excitement]] and [[19. Thinking and practicality]]. Rana mentions it in her book/videos. Also, check this [[https://medium.com/@jessjo/i-hate-the-word-technical-b1cad72950ab|being technical]]
7. Sharing knowledge, resources and thinking. It's so fun/dopamine hits. Rigorously:
	a. Incentivizes exploration, which is the only way to learn big things.
	b. Fear of "failure" is decreased significantly. It's an infinite gameüéÆÔ∏è.
	c. Increases the chance of everyone's success, and we have a better society.
	d. Saves enormous amounts of energy, time and resources - there's no need to filter stuff out/in. See [[41. Discriminative disorientation]], consequently we behave better and enjoy life.
	e. We can be our true selves, which updates our minds faster and we are presented with counter-arguments. **Just think of what would happen if people lied in an academic setting, it would be torture.**
	f. Teaching reinforces learning and we are able to see gaps better.
	g. Just think of the impacts - your musings, plans, this is huge. True fraternityüòÉÔ∏è. Elon Musk: I read books and talk to people.

FIXME: These qualities are those that I love, but find it difficult to implement, because I've seen the opposite behavior many times. I waste time.
