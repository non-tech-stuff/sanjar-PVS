====== 11. Things I need to retain ======
Created Tuesday 09 February 2021

Need to discuss societal, intellectual and other deep concepts
FIXME
1. Not being judgemental.
2. Loving the people around me.
3. Respecting people's choices.
4. Calm thinking - not defending a side and being doubtful. I can support a side, if I have data.

FIXME: These qualities are those that I love, but find it difficult to implement, because I've seen the opposite behavior many times. I waste time.
