====== 21. Knowledge and Honesty ======
Created Wednesday 03 March 2021

* I have been thinking of the relation between honesty(simplicity) and knowledge lately.
* Here's a seemingly difficult conundrum:
	It seems impractical(ahem) that so much understanding and knowledge can be created from very basic and simple constituents like experiment, thinking and solving interesting problems.
	I have always assumed that there was some 'source' of knowledge, which was responsible for the creating of knowledge, like a mine from which precious minerals can be extracted.
	
	This is why I delved into religion, thinking it will solve 'all'üòÖÔ∏è problems and was the only practical option to go forward in life.
	It will make the seemingly daunting and complex life easier.
	
	I had easily got good marks in my school in math and science thinking they lead somewhere great.
	And because studying is difficult and requires courage and deliberation, it was relatively easy to assume its difficulties will be solved by religion, somehow.
	It filled me with energy and provided motivation to take on the difficult subjects with ease. This was good.
* FIXME: I have to clear my intention if I really studied those subjects for themselves or for using it in order to utilize religion to solve problems easily.
* But here's a catch: My motivation was correct but belief was wrong.
* There is no such thing as universal source of knowledge, atleast in the form I thought.

=== Things to understand ===
* I have to study because I am interested.
* I should be curious, not rely on false things for solving problems
* I have to understand that science really has achieved what I thought it was impractical for it to achieve
* It is very fortune that this is the correct way, as far as now.
* Life is great in and of itself, and we are the ones who make the world a better place
* Thinking is great and powerful, but it can be misguided as easily.
* Life can be built on understanding and thinking. This is how we are here.
* We as children never wanted answers, we just had a flaming curiosity and that needs to be kept alive.
* Being motivated by a wrong reason is possible, and that can be remedied. The work was still real.

=== Things to let go ===
* Motivation has to be detached from false thoughts, because lies will just cause heartache at the end.
* Don't be hard on yourself, that you believed lies and studied for it. It helped, but is not carreable.
