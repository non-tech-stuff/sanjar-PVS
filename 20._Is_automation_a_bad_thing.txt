====== 20. Is automation a bad thing ======
Created Saturday 27 February 2021

=== Situation ===
* I love computer science
* It is difficult

=== Why think about this(closely related [[13. Virtual deadends and beliefs]]) ===
* I thought these questions were remnants of my religious ideas, or just the religious communities I've been in. https://jetpress.org/volume14/bainbridge.html
* But I think blaming "religion" may be false or partly true. There are other factors that affect thinking:
	* Societal thinking - entrepreneurial spirit is low.
	* Parents - were we allowed to make our decisions
	* School - how did classmates/teachers react, and thought about studies
	* Hype - false hype destroys a good tech, because we become "complacent"
* Honestly, I personally shrugged off things like patriarchy, sexism long ago in school. What I actively had in mind was religion. I don't know how, but it caused a great deal of demotivation. I was frightened to learn stuff.
* Whatever be the cause, it needs to be recognized and eliminated.
* Personally, I think no person should have to decide in terms of "religion" or "societal biases", because these are useless criteria.
* The losses(no friends, career, critical thinking) incurred in the process can potentially cause us to be really immoral, where we've lost sight of reality. Such a system is bound to collapse. **Painful** **disorientation causes wrong decisions, and creates problems, generally.**
* I read/learnt about many good things people have done logically and emotionally, and that is really something to cherish. It increased my self-confidence and curiosity.
* It feels like we can never do anything great, even if we try hard.

=== There are some arguments that make my head spin and cause a hell lot of anxiety ===
* AI wishes to undermine man - I don't know how to answer this. But AI is a great subject.
* Automation takes away jobs - This seems true, but is experimentally good. In the long run, automation does take away jobs.
* You have a malintent to replace people - This is wrong. I care a great deal about people.

=== I have no moral obligation to provide for anyone, in terms of jobs ===
After thinking a lot about what I'm doing. I reached at an important idea: "I'm not responsible to provide for anyone". This idea is the soul of freedom, because there are a hell lot of false things which can be banned for the "collective good of the society". I don't agree to this, it doesn't feel natural. In fact, it is one of the things that I feel deeply about, without any shame. Automating stuff â†’ people losing jobs may be true, but I cannot be held responsible for this. In fact, this kind of thinking will only increase poverty. Reason: We have invented a new thing with value v2, which is greater than v1(which is the norm). Using v1 now amounts to neglecting value, in fact, we are wasting resources to do stuff that doesn't have any real value. Such a society can never progress. I don't want to go into the paranoid reasons justifications of why tech is good - like "enemies getting technologically better", "epidemics might happen, they can be treated" etc. Because these reasons are also a way of saying that we should pursue science and tech just because of some situation. This demotivates me, instead of motivating me.

I love solving problems and would love to do a business, but only if it has some value. And value is precursor to wealth. Only things which have value are sold. Doing a business with stuff which has no value is like sitting on a ticking time bomb, it is not sustainable. In fact it only increases poverty: I will not be able to afford a good education for my children. This poverty and helplessness can potentially(I'll be glad if this is false) be a cause for them to study hastily without proper attention. They will be poor, and the cycle will continue.

So anyone giving jobs for stuff that has no value is actually the criminal, not the person taking the job.

Rate of obsolescence is at an all time high, and will only grow.

Systems like democracy and RTI(Right to Information Act, India) are possible only if we have technology.
* The US had a comical situation back in the 19th century. The law required a census to be conducted every 10 years, but it took 8 years for a census report to be developed. This is sick.
* Popuations grow exponentially and not linearly, and saying no to CS is a death wish. __''PARANOID reason''__

=== Deliberation not force ===
I personally want to help people and believe that all of us are capable of achieving anything we can conceive. The only way to do this is by spreading knowledge and giving the seeds of growth to people, not handing out cooked meals.

=== A sad coincidence ===
* Tech like supercomputers/AI are difficult to study.
* Having a wrong value("need has to be proved") will just fail here.
* It is very easy to give up on thinking.
* Being sad or hopeless kills the body from the inside.

=== Selfish reasons ===
* I hate standing at banks, railway counter etc. I love it that we can book tickets from home.
* I love that I can collaborate, know and learn with anyone anywhere.
* I love that we can create something from thin air through code.
Note: These reasons are universal, so they may potentially be a thing.

=== Why this affects me ===
* Not thinking clearly is not an option for me
* I hate it when the solution space "collapses" as anything is labelled "moral".
* I would be a great waste if I couldn't be happy in my life.

=== Conclusion ===
* I will not worry that CS will make our lives miserable.
* I shall cherish the fact that CS made our lives easier.
* I shall follow my heart and ambition, and use my perception filter.
* I shall be happy.
