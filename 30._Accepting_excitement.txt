====== 30. Accepting excitement ======
Created Wednesday 14 April 2021

FIXME: complete this. All of this is just a stub.
I am exited when I look at new ideas, knowledge and tech.
But there's a part inside my head, both intellectually and psychologically that says - "this will short circuit', "it is bad", "it is not as interesting".
* There's also a part that says - you are attracted to math, science just because it sounds cool but is not. You need to prove rigorously worth of this thing. This is one of my prejudice acting against me - I think people do math, science because it is cool, and don't fully understand it. They think of it like magic, they don't demagicify it. The prejudice wrong, but it is pretty common.
* I need to get out of this. I can control myself, and know what I want.
* Being cool is an added bonus that feels good - there's nothing wrong with it.
* Also, new knowledge may be perceieved as dangerous: this is normal.

What I need to prove, state: 
1. Attraction to math, science is good, natural and a very happy experience. There's nothing unhuman or spooky about it.
2. I am happy to be motivated and driven, and it is the only right thing to do. I want to be excited.

* Another point - I think people with forward-looking parents don't have this question, and they are so happy. I with my doubt make everything bad. The first point - having forward-looking parents is a very nice thing, but it is not necessary. Second - yes, I do make things bad, but it happens to everyone, even children mentioned before.
* I have had that I'm too fast - Idk why but I included God? in this proof to see this. Turns out I am happier, without believing. See [[./drive]]
