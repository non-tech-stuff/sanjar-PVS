====== 6. Curiosity as an answer ======
Created Thursday 04 February 2021

* This is correct.
Curiosity is actually the starting point of life and of survival, because the environment(both naturally and artifically) is changing. It has enabled everything that we know of except through our genes.
* Curiosity brings a kind of novelty, which makes us happy. This is a greedy solution.
* Curiosity solves many problems we have, or might have.
* Curiosity leads to science, which is the best tool humans have found till date.
* Being curious can cause us to be shunned, but that's okay. Living a life in your own skin is much more important than whims of the society.
