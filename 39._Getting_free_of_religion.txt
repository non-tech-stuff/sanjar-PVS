====== 39. Getting free of religion ======
Created Saturday 24 April 2021

=== Context ===
* I've had lots of problems, emotional as well as intellectual, with my religion(Islam).
* Due to these problems - I've become very sad, depressed, dangerously serious, unable to think clearly and live life to the fullest. It has had adverse affects on me - both mentally and physically.
* I know that many of the issues of my life, are obviously not due to religion. Many happened due to my mistakes, my biases, my upbringing, culture, environment.
* I understand that I am solely responsible for all things in my life, whether positive or negative. Blaming someone/something doesn't help on its own, except for diagnosis of a problem.
* I also understand that values and morals are decided best by reason and real experiences, rather than dogmatically assuming the truth of a set of rules, given by society, culture or tradition.

=== Am I angry ===
Yes. But it doesn't help, because being angry hurts the thinking process. I cannot reason properly.

=== What are the "problems" with Islam ===
Important: I'm only mentioning //problematic// ones here. There are some good ideas too.
* Many beliefs are shrouded in submission and authority. Many //laws// seem arbitrary.
* Tagging laws as sacred laws doesn't scale, and hasn't in the real world. There's no experimentation. Seems quite unrealistic and backwards.
* Many of the "examples" used in the Quran and Sunnah actually evoke very unrealistic situations, horrifying emotions. It seems to use fear, but with a coping mechanism. First it steals your rights from you, then 'gives' them to you. It is mental torture. Examples:
	* Noah's son - Got letting him drown, for no reason particular whatsoever. Problem with priority, even if the God was really there. Too cruel and depressing.
	* The ark - sounds too unrealistic.
	* Hell - unrealistic, paralyzing source of agony. Clear fear tactic. Shuts down the mind. Coping mechanisms evident at various places.
	* Abraham's son - trying to butcher him for a dream. Someone can argue that the dream was authentic, but it only justifies that Abraham had seriously messed up priorities. Same goes for the kid. Realistically - the father would be tried and jailed for the crime. This example, in particular, enslaves people and shackles their thinking.
	* Dajjal - a fear tactic that can be scaled as per convenience. Advices inaction and escape as solution.
	* Story of Lot - limits people's thinking about homosexuality. There's no encouragement for study and evidence for homosexuals. Also teaches condemnation of someone as close as his wife, for her belief. Note: There is a view that story of Lot only talks about rape and hatred - which is a good thing. Also, modern goverments are dealing with LGBTQ issues in a mature way now, even after having evidence. How can a community //freeze// very old laws based on belief?
* Gender segregation - this results in a loss of communication. It divides people, makes the world a difficult place to be in. Segregation leads to emotional and social immaturity. You just don't have experience.
* Veiling - forcing this is very problematic. Sense of identity and freedom is lost.
* Stigma of dating - I know quite well how a not having a companion can mess up life, focus, work. People might not want to get married, they may want to experiment, see if it works out between them.
* Stigma of sex and sexuality - Stigmatizing sex and the aspects sexuality can cause lot of psychological and physical problems. Anxiety caused by stigma can lead to addiction/objectification/unempathetic attitudes. Even if the person gets out of stigma, they still remain unhappy.
* Does not promote self-confidence. Promotes reliance on authority and scripture.

=== Effects of Islam - generally unknown to the believer ===
* Person loses a sense of self, confidence and deliberation. This is a major problem for democracies, where people are supposed to think on their own and make informed decisions
* Person loses a sense of morality based on reasoning and experience - religion overrides it. Morality becomes something humans cannot reason about.
* Freedom is something that is "granted", not something innate.
* Independence is pathologized.
* Secularism can become a compromise, not an ideal to strive towards.
* Leads to magical thinking, acceptance of conspiracy theories becomes easy. Can accelerate wishful thinking.
* Spirit of inquiry and critical thinking is damaged. 
* Learing curiosity, authenticity and excitement is lost to verification/enunciation of verses, ideas. This is very bad all, especially children.
* Leads to a narrow(unrealistic) world view and dogmatic way of thinking.
* Tags conformance, reliance on scriptures as positives. Spirit of reform is explicitly eliminated.
* Creates arbitrary bounds that shackle a person, internally.
* Segregating people on basis of religion/food habits leads to demotivation.

=== Effects of Islam - After some time ===
* Can lead to paradoxical definitions of freedom, equality and definiton of happiness.
* Can lead to authoritarian groups, operating on a blank check of "piousness".
* Self-injury may be normalized, which leads to loss of empathy and respect for people.
* Can lead to isolation, social immaturity and contempt for others.
* It can lead to bottled frustration and regret in later parts of life, causing depression, anxiety, inaction and addiction. This is anecdotal, not a speculation.

=== How can we get rid of such things ===
* For most of these things, it is difficult to argue judge whether they are right/wrong - especially if data(experience) is less.
* But we are born with bodies, and have emotions throughout our lives. This can be used to gauge ideas and beliefs. This prevents us from self-harm, and provides meaning to our lives.
* Emotions are not the only parameter, however.  They are a good duck-test.

=== What about other religions(old or future religions) ===
* While investigating about Islam, I encountered a profound question. Is it the best use of time to look for //the// religion out there. Maybe there's none, which is plausible, assuming that all religions are human-made, which I think now is true. Another problem with "looking" is that we don't work on stuff that's important, like personal goals, relationships. This damages our criteria to evaluate/add/remove personal-values that do exist.
* Also, religions may have irrational, unheathy attitudes which are difficult to evaluate.
* The idea of religion as law doesn't work - because laws need to shown to work at all times. And they must maximize freedom, survival and happiness for all people.
* The universe and the world is so big, and we've just started exploring freely - so it makes sense to collect data and then form hypotheses. This is better than trying to fit a hypotheses - which have known source and have no/false justification for phenomena.
* I think it is better to accept that we "don't know" than to know answers that are wrong. Let us be honest.
* Honesty and frankness can be scaled across time and space, and we form a collective understanding, without force. This drives innovation.
* Biologically: we ask questions and investigate, it is natural. Fortunately, this makes us happy and also increases our understanding.

=== What to do then ===
* Form your own values - by gathering data from authentic sources.
* Accept ideas that are rational and demonstrable.
* Live your life happily and be ambitious.
* Be courageous - always ask questions.
* Use [[15. Perception Filter]]
* Learn about other cultures and ideas - but gauge them properly.

=== What about God ===
Does not matter. You do your best.
See the diagram in [[30. Celebrate excitement]]

=== Being honest ===
* The whole point of this page is to know and care that I am human.
* And I love life.
* Religion is a choice, in the same way as I choose not to have one.
* Accepting that a failure of an idea in itself doesn't prove the opposite.
* Muslims //are// persecuted due to propaganda, contempt and falsehood. This is true. What Islam says or does is irrelevant to the treatment of Muslims, who are people. Human rights are inalienable.
* My friends/relatives are still dear to me. If I think otherwise, then I'd be hypocritical.
* I should strive to be open and clear about my stance, irrespective of whether people respect it.
* Because this whole page looked at observable effects which can be felt by all, it is very important to understand that people choose their behavior and values. If they are honest, their behavior should be good. People being honest is not guaranteed, which is OK.
* Important: There may be non-religious people who might despise or hurt religious people. That is a sad and wrong thing. As we form our and are responsible for our values, every person is an individual. Stay with people who have good-personal values.

=== Conclusion ===
Got rid of religion.

=== How as this helpful ===
I had developed PTSD, this solved it intellectually.
I have to now practice courage.
