=== Logical and emotional brain operate in parallel ===
I had a dream today(i.e. I woke up when I saw it). The dream is quite simple.
I am at a dinner table in a big hall. The tables are separate with around 10 people on each table.
My table is half full.
I'm eating the main course, and there's a person sitting on my left, let's call his Buck.
The waiter comes and starts placing desserts to the left of our plates. I'm delighted to see that.
Buck eats his dessert and grabs mine. I protest and tell him to give it back, but he doesn't reply.
In the dream Buck is bigger(stronger) than I am. I look around my table, and people are either silent or laughing.
I'm enraged. I try to (snatch)physically it back from him. Consequently, Buck gets up and starts to walk. I start following him and try to snatch the sweet. I can observe that there's a guy or two with him, maybe his friends or sidekicks, but they just laugh or smile at by inability to snatch my sweet back. While walking, a ~40 yr bespectacled man crosses us. I ask for his assistance, to which he looks at me and then ignores all of us.
I can also see that some people(n<3) are following us 4(Buck, me and his sidekicks).
Now, I'm starting to lose my patience. After all this walking we reach the corner of the hall, where Buck is leaning against the corner.

He is not eating the sweet, and his friends are grinning.
At this point, I'm completely mad, and try to punch him in the face.
Fortunately, the punch doesn't reach because Buck tries to defend himself, letting the sweet to fall off.

The sweet is caught by a person(say Larry, one of the guys that were following us), he gives the sweet to me and smiles, signalling that I shouldn't have been so angry.
I walk away back to the table with my sweet, while Buck(and his sidekicks) just stand there.

I start thinking and figure about something very important about the human brain, and I wake up.

=== What I figured out, the "thing" ===
* I though this inside the dream itself.
In the dream, after getting my sweet back. I wondered why I didn't think of the idea first. The idea that I'd act like punching him so that he'd let go of the sweet. It occurred to me that I was very angry and emotional. But Larry was smart: he follwed and caught the sweet when it was falling. Who is Larry, and how did he use the simple fact that Buck would need both hands for defending himself. Well, Larry is someone created by my brain, and the whole idea of catching the sweet also came from my brain.

My brain was doing two seemingly disjoint things at once.
The brain was supporting my emotional(angry) version and thinking logically at the same time.
How is this possible? Well, it just happened. In fact, the brain did so very easily.

=== Why is this important ===
Well, earlier that day, i.e 27th Feb 2020, before sleeping I had been thinking that because of all the nonsense about so called practicality, my mining of religion etc had damaged my mind. And because the mind is interconnected in a complex way, I'll never be able to remove all the stupid thinking which was hindering my thought process, both in studies and well as personal life. These thoughts included the idea that AI would never work, computers were overkill etc, which gave me the chills because all this works. Most of these thoughts are emotional and/or wrong(i.e not thought through).

Fortunately, it appears that the brain has separate locations for emotions and logical thinking. These sections are not only separate, but they can even work in parallel with virtually no interference.

=== Does this solve a problem ===
I think so. I'll just have to control my emotional thinking. And I know now that this won't have any bad effects at my logical ones. This way I'll be able to mend my emotional part, without hurting my logical one.

This is a great discovery, personally, because it demonstrates that even though both logical and emotional things are present in the brain and work together, but are independent.

=== Follow up questions ===
1. Is this demo valid? - I think so, I did this without any deliberation.
2. Was the emotional part, the 'soul' - I don't think so, it was just a part of the brain. Even if it were, my reflection of the event at the end of the dream and me waking up shows that my logical brain is incharge.
3. Why is the emotional part even there - I think it evolved because in forests and other dangerous places, it is impossible to arrive at a good conclusion by thinking logically. So the brain just approximates. This is why emotion is connected to 'percieved danger'. I just need to understand that there's no danger now, and the emotional part is overreacting.

=== Social acceptance and emotion ===
I think logically most of the times. Then I look at the problem emotionally, and this approach seldom gives the correct answer.
So I ignore my emotional side. This act of ignoring creates another insecurity: that I'm stupid and cannot be trusted because I ignore my own emotions.
I need to get over this stupid insecurity.
I am choosing to ignore it willingly.
Also, I damaged my conscience and confidence by thinking everything in term of religion/cultural norms. This has been very damaging for me, and I don't trust myself when I ignore my emotions.
But I have to do it.
I'll only accept those emotions which I've learnt from trusted sources.

=== Conclusion ===
I shall not worry that I've lost my brain. I haven't, I just need to recalibrate my emotional responses. That's it.
