====== 34. Worrying about kids ======
Created Tuesday 20 April 2021

=== Situation ===
I caught myself wasting time, thinking in a wrong way. So the cycle goes:
1. I ruminate my mistakes from the past - same things most often.
2. I try to come up with solutions that I could have had, which is **good**.
3. I plan on how to //ensure// the same ideas in my children - this is **bad**.
Note - Feynman's technique is irrelevant here. It is a learning-teaching exercise, for the self, where you imagine the audience. Fortunately, it happens to be useful for explanations.

=== Problems with such thinking ===
* The flaw with no.3 is that I wants to drill down the answer, instead of letting the child coming up with one.
* The child is not treated as an individual, which is totally negative.
* The child is not happy - the idea may be very difficult/very easy for them. In both cases, the child gets bored. Upon excessive pressure, it may lead to self-doubt and sadness.
* The child becomes dependent(mentally), which is totally negative. It never creates a sense of self.

=== Do nothing then? ===
Doing nothing - wildly optimistic
Do a hell lot - wildly pessimistic
FIXME: needs study, but not urgent.

=== What to do then ===
Goals:
* Help them explore the world.
* Inculcate a love of life.
* Inculate the love of learning, not the need for it.
* Create a sense of independence, agency and deliberation.
* The child needs to learn to use happiness and rigor together.

=== Does this work? ===
* Naturally - the child doesn't know what they want to know, so they explore. We'll reinforce just that.
* The world is changing very fast, and keeping up with it is the wise thing to do. A person who loves learning does not need an external force. It's a clear win-win scenario.
FIXME: needs study, but not urgent.

=== Conclusion ===
* Keep yourself first. Don't think about kids.
* Relax.
* If you don't live the best according to your values, your model cannot be trusted.
* You can't create a happy system being unhappy.
