====== 40. Discriminative disorientation ======
Created Sunday 25 April 2021

FIXME: add content properly
I recently was reading about the Zionist settlements in Palestine.
I am all for people moving to wherever they like.
But what about a the nation recieving these people?
Does it have a say.

I seem to have a bias:
1. Americans should allow immigrants
2. Israeli forced settlements is wrong.
3. Maharashtra right-wing parties should allow immigrants, is this acceptable.

I don't know how to decide?

--------------------
Should i skip this topic?

Why do I want to do this:
1. I sense a lot of disorientation
2. I sense a lost sense of self-development which has been going on since Jan 2021.
3. I am making the same mistake as 2014 watching the first stupid video.

Why should I continue:
1. I want to understand stuff
2. A lack of understanding is fuel for bigots/politicians and hype.
3. I don't want to have a broken world view.

What should I do. It must satify the following conditions:
1. It must retain my happiness and relevance.
2. I should retain a sense of observation and exploration.
3. I should not deviate to sides.
4. I must be happy.
5. I should prefer personal ambitions as top priority
6. I shouldn't be distracted.
7. QnA should be valid for me - I should remain honest and committed to my values.

Please think about this.

=== Context info ===
* A sense of discomfort was experienced, which made me sad, angry, irritable.
* It was a feeling that I am in danger due to my name, identity.
* This can cause a lot of time-wastage, disorientation, worst case desensitization.
* I know I have to learn to protect myself - but I'm afraid I may deviate from my goals. And also lose my happiness in the process.
* Fortunately, there are many instances of people enduring such times, with their intellect and sense of self-intact:
	* Albert Einstein - near death
	* Alan Turing - suicide
	* Richard Feynman - fraternity discrimination
	* Kurt Goedel - career roadblocks
	* Japansese people in 1942-1945
	* Edward Snowden - criminalized by his own country
	* Rana El Kaliouby - 9/11 and her courage to still go to the UK
	* Mohammad Atalla - name change required. Check if is consensual - doesn't seem to be.

* What these people have in common:
	* All are leaders/high achievers in their fields
	* Some of them were defiant, others hid. I don't want to judge their actions.
	* All of them retained a sense of happiness
	* All them retained a sense of awe and curiosity for their field
* Other data - Many non-persecuted people also take a toll for this. They don't seem to get finicky. It doesn't mean I have to be like them. Nothing negative.
* Fortunately - I got rid of God and religion, before this thought occurred. No stupid explanations.
* Problems for me:
	* Hiding is unnatural for me. It takes a heavy toll on my functioning, to be honest it took a heavy toll on them all.
	* I fear that I may be desensitized
	* My father did very stupid things due to these things
	* I can become cynical and not take care of myself due to such things
	* It gets too demotivating for me
Can I do this - I don't think so.
* Know this Sanjar - you are not weak or oversensitive. It is a real problem or you are being dreaming.
* Ignorance/Avoidance - Is this the best way?
* What to do - just maintain your level of happiness and rigor.
Do I have a choice - I don't know.
Am I just being stupid - I hope I am.
