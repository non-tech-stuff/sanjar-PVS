====== 40. Trail of happiness ======
Created Sunday 25 April 2021

FIXME: Add this properly to QnA. This not only solves many issues, but also talks about convergence of good values.

=== Read ===
This seems like philosophy of mathematics, see wiki.

=== Trail ===
* I started with solving the problem of surnames.
* Then I started calculating number of names, using american-dict in UNIX.
* After doing this, I realized how important identity, and the importance of individuality and deliberation.
* During the calculation, I revisited what 0! meant. The thought of each permutation as a picture helped a lot.
* I questioned why combinatorics is important, especially for kids. ''The answer seems to be passion and happiness to play.''
* My idea of "picture", led to the idea of complex numbers - for representing polynomials. This then lead to vectors and complex numbers for the general functions.
* I questioned - how do mathematicians support themselves. And playfullness is very important.
* I looked up Jim Simons - that let me to think how he used math to grow businesses. And how he wast honest with the Army.
* I also observed that combinatorics is frequently used all over the place, from math, science to computer science.
* I started thinking how math has been benefical(in addition to being a very good toy), but without modern science. This is quite simple - circumference of earth, shortest distance(Pythagoras) are all examples of very useful. And many more - like counting, addition using unary numbers to decimal system.
* I then took in modern science - it can be used to predict stuff like age of the universe, capacity of the sun, orbits of the planets. This is very important for various reasons - future expeditions, observing planets and then generalizing them to Earth.
* Science also led engineering, that led to telecommunication.
* This increased empathy, trade and lead to a better quality of life.
* From empathy, I went to emotions as information. This can help us communicate with aliens. Help us understand plant/animal lives etc. This can bring peace which otherwise will seems to result in catastrophe. Understanding aliens may lead us to understand each other and assimilate, so all's good. Obviously, there's a risk - but we are not pacifists anyway.
* I thought about AI/ML, where we need make hypothesis. We can see our biases and incorrect intuitions in real time. This will lead to good humility, which increases with our ambition to do better. The more the good data, the better. We can find hidden rules. We understand the universe in a better way.
* AI doesn't can be done mentally, but requires compute cost.
* I need to be comfortable with real computers, they were built by passion and an understanding of how circuits can represent logic gates, and how gates can represent numbers. Keep this with yourself.
* Also, given the risk and cost of moving mass and energy, it is better that we become very good at analytics - an article from Tata chairman helped(data vs energy doubt dichotomy) here. This can make us very effective in curbing negative effects like pollution, global warming, while still being very ambitious.
* Automation is something that must be at the forefront. Automating stuff generates knowledge about systems - it's free knowledge. Manual labor is degrading to the human body and produces no extra knowledge, at least from a scalability point of view. Also, increase in automation helps bring down cost of stuff, increases trade. This makes life easier. Automation gives jobs and also makes the smart.
* In all these "connections" via empathy, science. It became clear that any large society needs to have graph algorithms for predictions, because we need to transport food, water and data to people. This holds for all kinds of goverments - democracy, monarchy etc. See [[https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/24/forget-moores-law-algorithms-drive-technology-forward/|Forget Moore's law, Algorithms drive tech forward]]
* The possible ''convergence'' of tech, science, literature(good for thinking) for ''empathy, good humility, ambition'' helps human advance beyond earth and also treat each other the best they can. ''This is huge.''
* This helped me understand why people like Ray Kurzweil are happy with transhumanism, maybe the've figured out this possible convergence of needed values. FIXME: check claim for wishful thinking.
* Like in Japan, due to buddhism, a decrease in fear of death led to less violence and calmed down people.
* Optional: Produced stress and thinking stopped for a few minutes. I had a guilt problem with buddhism, but "getting rid of religion" solved it without any contempt. I didn't want to learn a religion, cause it's traumatic and boring. I then recalled that monks don't have relationships, and women are also not well represented. The fact of being celibate directly challenge my values of happiness, I find the idea to live alone total Bullshit. So I am going to reject buddhism happily. Ideas are always welcome.
* This also lead to the idea that we need for futurists. Because futurists can unlock ideas that may be timeless, so that we can uncover our past as well. Obviously, the results will be immensely helpful for the present. Being futurist is a very good thing. A futurist definitely needs knowledge of the past, which is some sort of buffer against unbounded wishful thinking - which is what I feared about futurists.
* Also, none of this stuff is complex to understand, anyone can understand it. Also, this means that knowledge(in all forms) must be democratized, celebrated and made easily accessible. The scope of growth is so huge, can't ignore this.
* First principle thinking changed the world, especially for ideas, science, engineering:
	* Makes democratization possible - small enough to transmit, publising cost is also low.
	* Makes communication possible - easy to translate short messages, less scope for mistakes. Makes for an equal society.
	* Removes scope for obscurities by the teachers - message is small and clear.
	* The principle is easier to falsify, if if turns out to be wrong. Related principles can also be changed - i.e. Reduces risk with minimum effort. **i.e. the system is robust**
	* Systems are easier to debug, scale
	* Cost per unit is decreased but overall profit increases by a huge amount.
	* Easy/fast to learn and apply. Because learnt ideas can be tested against the principle.
	* The learner doesn't need to trust the source - there commonly held assumptions can be used discard/accept information.
* Optional: Being frank and actively avoiding being hesitant changed the world. I am too happy and have a lot to lose, so obscurity/hesitation is unacceptable to me.
* I should never stop to think I'm being wrong, only my ideas can be wrong. And that's still progress.

=== Personal trail ===
* I remembered that this whole journey of math and science started with courage, happiness and playfulness. It also showed how compulsive behaviors and poverty-emulating attitudes can cause us so much damage - cognitively and emotionally.
* I understand how a companion is so important to a happy and functioning brain. Love this fact.
* Understanding companion, in my case women, is so important. We always study our pets, car, laptop, mobile, clothes(for washing instructions), accessories. How could then have people ignored their own companions and their desires and needs. Seems to be utter nonsense. 
* Optional:A blow to stopping of PDA prevention. I refuse to give it up, because we can feel happiness anywhere. Why wait to go somewhere secluded: memories are associated with places, smells. Not being together at places will make life too boring. In a free system, people will have lots of happy memories. Memories are very important for healthy life, specially if the partners are alone.
* Optional: Dating is very important. A sense of chemistry, values, smell, and [[https://globalnews.ca/news/1678261/swapping-spit-and-testing-chemistry-how-kissing-germs-help-you-pick-your-partner/|taste]](kiss) is a very important for choosing partners. There's no other option. Also, see https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/12/kissing-fun-dna-neurotransmitters-science. https://hermoney.com/connect/love/can-sex-make-you-smarter/
* Kalpana Chawla's - "You are just your intelligence", created another thought - I want my companion to be smart and capable, at least better than me. This way she can atleast undertand how important they are. If she is not a thinker, it will be so sad that I cannot tell her how important she is. And being a first principled thinker - we can talk even if we belong to different domains. **This deals a strong blow to **my guilt(and supposed neediness) that someone not being smart(in a fundamental way, not specific to me, but specific would be better) is really guilt. Conversely, she would want a smart person. So, I want a smart person as my companion, because smart should mean more honest, empathetic(ignoring our mistakes and problem of evil), adventurous and happy. **Maybe this is what compatibility means.**
* Also it is important to understand that as I rewrote my values, anyone can do so. This means that my filtering based on beliefs is problematic. I'm just looking for matching values and goals, with some degree of predictable positiveness.
* The point about plants/animals also establishes that I should be more near nature. It will make me feel good.

=== Conclusion ===
* It all happened because I refused to give up happiness, playfulness and hope.
* Values have been positively reinforced.

I hope my hair grows back!
