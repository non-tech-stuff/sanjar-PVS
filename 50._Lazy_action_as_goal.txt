====== 50. Lazy action as goal ======
Created Monday 06 September 2021

* Action on failure/discomfort. Until then, everything is right.

=== Applications ===
* Don't worry about details of an action, lazy action with what I am thinking now, details will come later. They are important, but that doesn't mean they need to be thought of before. **This is important and should be kept in mind. **Why this works - well idk. Gets rid of the //installation/uninstallation/automation_first// mentality.
