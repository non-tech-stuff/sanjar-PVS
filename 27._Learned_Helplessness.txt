====== 27. Learned Helplessness ======
Created Sunday 11 April 2021

TODO: Complete this page, read the ''wikipedia page'', [[https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/lhtheoryevidence.pdf|paper|Intro to learned helplessness]] and [[https://www.appstate.edu/~steelekm/classes/psy5150/Documents/Hiroto&Seligman1975-learned-helplessness.pdf|generality of helplessness]], properly and make the page. This also helps, 'https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-learned-helplessness-2795326'
Context: I was analyzing the mathDoubt/ knowledgeDoubt. It obviously translated to "Happiness" from HRO. But I had not defined happiness properly, so I didn't count on it. In the end it ended on personal freedom, which I was required to prove. It is east to see that justifications for a life are not required. It also showed that I didn't have a well formed self, which might have resulted from the "can't tell, can't do" contemporary belief in religious people and in general. My stubborness as a a percieved "negative" quality made the problem worse. This is why i call this inability to do what I feel as "learned helplessness".

FIXME: I also understand why I shun people who speak too rurally. This is because I've seen some(which for me is most, because I've seen very few) talk in a helpless and with bad explanatory style. This is why I avoid them and get furious. I understand perfectly that speaking tones mean different things in different culture and I am OK with that. What i was subconciously rejecting, was "maybe" a resistance to learned helplessness. Prima facie: Read from 1st occurence of "The Role of Explanatory Styles" in [[https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-learned-helplessness-2795326.]] 

TODO: This day, it started after reading this quote from "Broken adults come from broken children. Broken society comes from broken adults. Be the change." in [[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hidden-truth-behind-why-we-failing-adults-zelna-lauwrens.]] It is stupid to think broken people can do good stuff.

TODO: Avoid thinking how others(Indians - of all strata, however rich or religious and community in general) cope and "live" with this shit, but first study helplessness. Compromise is the last option.
