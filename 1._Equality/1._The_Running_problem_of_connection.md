# 1. The Running problem of connection
Created Sunday 04 April 2021


* I've had the following questions for a long time, for the contemporary sense of "fitness":
	1. Women vs Men, in terms of efficacy.
	2. Race vs Race
	3. Lang vs Lang(human language, style of speaking etc)
	4. Religion vs Religion
	5. Disabled people
	6. Animals

And other protected classes.

* It was easier to solve many things, except Women vs Men. This took me arount 2 days to think thr.


#### • Approaches I've tried, in order:

1. Evolutionary biology - asexual vs sexual reproduction. Reason: Patriarchy "considers" child bearning as the "criteria".
2. Thinking from higher order first principles - happiness, freedom, hope, encouragement, relations, emotional transactions. I was fooled by the bad guys, because they think women don't have amplified faculties. Damn, I should have used the Sagan Standard🙄️.
3. Modern societal laws - I filtered the ones considered "good", that I had learnt through my social studies class until class 10th.
4. Thinking about the historical data about women, from men. Richard Feynman was interesting to read - he said the whole conundrum(of women being inferior) exists because of a loss of communication. The guy's smart and right. Tell you later about this.
5. Examples of achievements by Women - Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie, Lisa Randall, Jane Austen, JK Rowling, Kalpana Chawla's "You are just your intelligence", Grace Hopper, Emmy Noether, Fei Fei Li, Barabara Liskov and many more.
6. Examples of women alive today - Whom I know/acknowledge(n>20) in my local circle. This is **dangerously** low.
7. Thinking about myself: If happiness, freedom, autonomy, and I was just a child producing machine - what would happen. Well, this is unbearable to think. Patriarchs can disregard these issues, because they believe women don't have such faculties.
8. After wasting a day, I questioned how the "society" know that this is true. It turns out they didn't, they were/are making stuff up. It is some sort of sexual insurance, well - what a poor(internal poverty) and evil people.
9. How humans learn - We learn through experiences, and this experience is shut off to women. I remember that I though magically or supressed expression when I was small. I was afraid of speaking up. This happened until I hit rock bottom, I reached class 7th. Being fed up, I started to read my books just for the sake of understanding. This, as you would have figured, worked. In fact, it is the only thing I know that really works in a sustainable way. There was no looking back then, I have not stopped understanding the world around me. **But all this**, is either not offered to girls, or their fears remain(either explicitly or implicitly by the environment). It doesn't take long before they bootstrap patrirarchy, and start promoting the same idea, which is normal, because they were taught so.
10. IGUS approach - this is quite radical. All organisms, according to a paper discussing why we can understand the universe at <https://www.arxiv.org>, are basically IGUS(Information Gathering and Utilizing Systems). The paper is pretty simple and plausible. And to think of women, an IGUS, as incapable of the faculty of thinking and understanding is clearly absurd and dangerous.


#### The turntable

* There is another approach, If women were really "inferior" or were "dumb objects" for the male's use. This feels like death sentence for me(and for them):
	* What about her as an individual - someone who lives in the same environment. What do I make of their existence?
	* I cannot really communicate with me partner.
		* She cannot really understand what I do and love.
		* I am unable to explain to her why I do what I do, and how fun my work is.
		* My love is hollow, as there is no real respect. This has been contested, but to me, this is the core of any relation.
	* My mum, sister:
		* She cannot teach me about the world
		* She cannot teach me about living in the world
		* My love and respect for her are hollow
		* She is no more than a wrapper I came in.
	* My daughters, if any:
		* I cannot talk to her, because she won't understand it.
		* I will love her, but won't provide autonomy.
		* I won't accept her as an individual

After thinking this, I realized I don't want to live in such a boring world, where you have no meaningful relations, where people can't do their best.

#### The core problem
There are two problems for people like me, who wished to measure how dangerous patriarchy was and if it's justifications were really "natural":

1. It is very difficult to prove one's ability to someone else. See [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Ramazan_Antar) and [this(read from 1st occurrence of the word "women")](https://www.wired.com/2012/06/turing-centenary-speech-new-aesthetic/).
2. It's a very unhappy thing to have to prove yourself, leaving behind this amazing world.
3. Contempt is rampant.
4. It is unnatural and stupid to assume impossibility - People do things because they are interested and capable, they don't have to see if they fit some "criteria", set by anyone. Natural laws are by character interesting.


* The handshake solves all of this, scientifically and happily.
* Note: Any being, intelligent being, would never justify its existence.


#### Reading ahead, collecting data

* I started reading more, and found instances of:
	* Women doing very complex work - Legal stuff
	* Women talking about these absurd and criminal mindsets. This is a very powerful duck test that patriarchy is wrong.
* Trying to read "Liberating Life: Woman’s Revolution" by Abdullah Ocalan.
* I am right: see [Stupid rules kill boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqDCnOmyA88), [Being frank and helping each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ8Np5EST3A)
* If you are "mathematical", it's boring/clerical. If you are not, you're not smart. [Women, Conundrum of Skill](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/tech-history/dawn-of-electronics/untold-history-of-ai-invisible-woman-programmed-americas-first-electronic-computer)


#### Conclusion
We can conclude from this discussion that:

* The world is a beatiful place where everyone is free.
* I should be motivated and encourage people in their endeavors,
* Partriarchy robs women and me(and all of us) of a *life*.
