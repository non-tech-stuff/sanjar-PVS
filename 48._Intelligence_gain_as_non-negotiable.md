# 48. Intelligence gain as non-negotiable
Created Wednesday 19 May 2021

Of course, this includes knowledge gained.

#### Challenges(which actually anchor intelligence):

* **Fun/Calm** - follow your mood. Easily follow my "Model". Do if fun.(but try to prime yourself maturely). Ignore beliefs/information/biases are handled properly. **Also, I'm not hesitant, so I aim(goal) like crazy(after proving its rigor).**
* **Emotions** - fighting nature, yeah!!, R in HRF only makes me intelligent and motivated.
* **Honesty** - obvious for a bootstrapped endeavor, I want everyone to have knowledge for free(because I'm bootstrapped). This helps people, that includes me. Big advantage - people generate a plethora of ideas, new use-cases - huge gain of intelligence. **Optimize ruthlessly - don't waste money/resources, automate except on projects.**
* **Money** - need an amount that's enough for a comfortable life and bootstraps my endeavors. How: 
	1. Use business models to bootstrap all endeavors.
	2. Keep knowldege generated public at all times.
	3. Pitch to investors for seeding.
	4. Try to solve itches that depends on the concepts, pitch to investors.

Stick to the goal, succeed in it. There's no failure - no money is lost(net profit: intelligence gained, investor sponsored your endeavor!). The goal is to maximize intelligence - most failures encountered, most intelligence again. Increase business model research when money is required. **Pursuing money for discovering powerful economic models is also a worthwhile effort, though. **See [Elon Musk](https://www.businessinsider.in/thelife/news/the-fixation-on-elon-musks-billionaire-ness-overlooks-the-fact-that-he-doesnt-care-about-money/articleshow/75638725.cms)

All in all intelligence(with honesty) makes the world just and happy. And it makes us more intelligent. Win-win situation, also helps in discovering win-win scenarios.

#### Effects

* Have fun.
* Good communication, brings people together.
* Decreases work time, increases number of problems solved.
* Good behavior, less poverty mindset.


Note: There are 8 types of intelligences, for humans, AFAIR.
