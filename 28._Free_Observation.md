# 28. Free Observation
Created Sunday 11 April 2021

FIXME: write this properly
I've had problems justifying that I(having my childhood, in the Muslim community, it's impact and Indian community scenario) would have done things which Alan Turing, Albert Einstein and others did. I find it a very pessimistic thought to entertain. To **prove**, that I would have also done so is a very destructive exercise that is plain time-waste according to me.

I, personally believe that I can do anything once I decide and work on it. This can be anything, however hard. If HRF is OK, I should be OK.

The thing with this contrained sense of self is that it requires me to justify that:

1. I am equal to those people, in terms of potential at least. This leads to hellish problems like childhood, religion, country, gender, environment, culture etc. I don't consider color, language and others because there're don't care params. See [1. Equality](./1._Equality.md)
2. My mindset is correct, and matches there's. This is problematic because this not a strict requirement, and is still dependent on the first one.


*****


* Now that I've understood I'm not really constrained by my params, what do I make of this.
* What I wish is true - I can use their experiences(data) as if they are my neighbours and use it to make my life good. I'll be very happy if this is possible. I just need to understand what "they sought", and if it's really correct.

Rigor:
Pros:

* I gather data
* I develop a will to see their data

Cons:

* There are "good" things which are very stupid inside, I should'nt take this thing in.
* I don't want to be dependent on someone.

Getting around the cons:

* Use your extended knowledge base to ignore bad things and take good things.
* Don't get attached to the ideology or other non-frank stuff. Analyze what they are saying and note good ideas.
* Always remember that you can be fooled, and people may fool or be fooled. Everyone can make mistakes. Information on the web can be heavily biased.


Note: I do with every source of information, using the [15. Perception Filter](./15._Perception_Filter.md) anyway. It's working quite well.

#### Why am I doing this

* Others experiences are a form of communication.
* Any remaining "otherness" is reduced significantly.
* It increases empathy.
* Helps in forming a working and happy worldview.
* It reinforces that params are not critiera. It's a good thing they can be used as identifiers.
* It makes it easier for me: people have encountered problems that I have before.
* It tests my beliefs.
* I feel positive.


#### What to do

* Go ahead, read, analyze and learn. Remember that this is your decision. Things may be biased heavily.
* Accept that people are the same around the world, our shared environment behaves the same for all.


#### How to do this

* You have to strictly observe ideas and behavior.
* Conditions should be used to gauge the effect of ideas, living as a freethinker.
* You shouldn't ingrain conditions as first, because that is not always the case. Go after the "sought" part.
* The "sought" may be completely stupid, even if the outcome is good.
* Reasonable(passing filter test) good ideas are always welcome, irrespective of effect.


#### Conclusion

* Everyone is your family, trust them as you would your immediate family. 
* Of course, they can lie, cheat and be fooled. Use the filter.
* Even you can be fooled, Happy exploring!!
