====== 29. Companionship as a goal ======
Created Wednesday 14 April 2021

FIXME: companionship should be the cause, reproduction is an effect, which may never even happen(see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman|Arlene Greenbaum]]). Personally companionship is happier. Strong claim: Reproduction as a goal is impractical and hollow, however rigorous.
**This is a stub**
Problems this will solve:
1. I am able to understand that dating is a very good thing.
2. Help me tag make things like money, status, as don't cares.
3. Make me realize that love and being together is the healthy thing
4. Makes public display of affection adorable and a happy phenomena.
Try to complete this.

Q. How did I get started and with this and realized dating is a great oppurtunity that is maligned in my community(its changing, that's good).
R. I read 'Girl Decoded' book, it was important because :
	1. Rana has the same belief system(or remnants as me), so I can relate.
	2. She honestly and spefically mentions it. 
	3. She critizes people who think it is bad. Her regret shows that this is true.
	4. Another thing she does it that she is brave enough to challenge the consensus - and give me the motivation to do the same.
	5. Her act of making doing what she wants reemphasizes the need for listening to yourself.
Note: It should be noted that despite I was open and had a free mind for dating and relationships. Rana's attitude helped a lot, because it exists in an environment that I can relate.
