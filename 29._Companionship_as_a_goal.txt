====== 29. Companionship as a goal ======
Created Wednesday 14 April 2021

FIXME: companionship should be the cause, reproduction is an effect, which may never even happen(see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman|Arlene Greenbaum]]). Personally companionship is happier. Strong claim: Reproduction as a goal is impractical and hollow, however rigorous.
**This is a stub**
Problems this will solve:
1. I am able to understand that dating is a very good thing.
2. Help me tag make things like money, status, as don't cares.
3. Make me realize that love and being together is the healthy thing.
4. Makes public display of affection adorable and a happy phenomena.
Try to complete this.

Q. How did I get started and with this and realized dating is a great oppurtunity that is maligned in my community(its changing, that's good).
R. I read 'Girl Decoded' book, it was important because :
	1. Rana has the same belief system(or remnants as me), so I can relate.
	2. She honestly and spefically mentions it. 
	3. She critizes people who think it is bad. Her regret shows that this is true.
	4. Another thing she does it that she is brave enough to challenge the consensus - and give me the motivation to do the same.
	5. Her act of making doing what she wants reemphasizes the need for listening to yourself.
Note: It should be noted that despite I was open and had a free mind for dating and relationships. Rana's attitude helped a lot, because it exists in an environment that I can relate.

TODO: add a page that 'sex' and companionship is a must for adults, of any age. It shoudn't and can't be supressed. People must ask what they want, and have priorities. It was a huge problem for me, not only because I had no love-life, but because it was "morally" wrong, which further intensified guilt/addiction and a sense of helplessness. I performed bad due to this abstinence. Having a happy love life is important, it increases performance drastically. **Had to battle abstinence-mindset, which lead all the way to patriarchy and segregation. I felt scared, then remembered H in HRF. We wont't and can't shackle people, and sexual desire is important. People want meaningful relations. I don't care about 'some' stupid people.** This is going to be difficult, because my community doesn't believe in it. No problem, I'll charge forward with my goals and science. **Fear is my worst enemy**. Just imagine what Rana might have gone through while ending the stigma of dating. Inspirational. Also, I can't trust anyone on this subject - too much bias. Education and confidence is my greatest asset. Being principled and being driven will change everything. I realized how shackled I am, and how silent and dependent I have become, even after so much self-work. I am armed but don't have control. It feels unreal and the correct ideas feel wrong.

Many prominent academics were highly sexual - Einstein, Feynman, Wittigenstein, Kalpana Chawla, Schrodinger(Love > Sex), Marie Curie. That's a lot of data. So sex isn't bad, it is our drive and ambition that matters. I can't live without it anyway. Restrictions don't help. See Rana El Kaliouby. [[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0410-orenstein-girls-sex-dutch-20160410-story.html|Dutch model, promotes loving relationships government treats teens as individuals.]] I have data now, way to go!! And the Dutch's model discourages promiscuity.

FIXME: I've noticed that having a partner really de-stresses me and makes me more ambitious and happy. I have experienced it, felt a surge of some chemical, and the stress just busts away. Same happens with seeing kids. It's natural, but it's still a choice that I'd make. Feeling alone is the worst feeling, it hurts more than it lets me focus on work. I see parallels in Feynman, Elon Musk, Einstein, Curie, Euler. Not being stressed maybe makes them think more clearly. Fear of not being able to provide does paralize, but I can't live without also. Better innovate and keep moving forward.

Elon Musk atleast knows a lot about human thinking, that's why he created his own school. He knows how important thinking properly is. The guy has happy + rigor. A positive force for my hypotheses. Plus his words being "depressing" and how he ignored depressing stuff. I maybe on the right track, but I've got to work in the real world. Keep my spirits and curiosity high. Being frank and open.
Additionally, as I've understood, he doesn't believing in teaching basic values to children. The first approach principle is also quite powerful, resonates with me. Makes things very clear.

Another thing, your father cannot ruin you. You can be a good person, no matter what. Don't carry that burden. I know you don't.
Note: See what people sought, not people themselves.

FIXME: Looks matter, but how much? Kalpana Chawla's life, [[https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://www.dizain.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kalpana-chawla-quotes-do-something.jpg&imgrefurl=https://www.dizain.in/kalpana-chawla-quotes-do-something/&h=500&w=750&tbnid=ZnQsgwmvp0rlEM&tbnh=183&tbnw=275&usg=AI4_-kQTPZMT1HM9ABx8AhTPxwaR6PHg2g&vet=1&docid=qvqsDSSdgGOjCM|clear and happy thinking]], https://starsunfolded.com/kalpana-chawla/. Removed my biases. Got married @ 23. Age hypothesis rejected, sense of self, easy-going attitude positively reinforced by a high degree.
