====== 37. Ban Hesitation ======
Created Friday 23 April 2021

FIXME: hestitation.

=== Never hesitate to be passionate, insightful ===
It is very important that I be passionate and happy as I feel. Supressing passion is like a giving up on a wonderful opportunity. The passion may be love, affection, understanding of a concept, an idea or any such thing. Sanjar, you need to make sure that you're always passionate, and not hesitant(tired). This will lead to a lovely, active and successful life. You shouldn't think about how others feel, and assume that they'll be OK. This is an assumption of happiness from the recieving person/crowd, and that the act of passion is good. Hesitation will only kill passion and confidence in all aspects of life, just imagine personal life. It is too safe.

FIXME: vulnerability.

=== Vulnerability ===
* This is already the F part in HRF.
Vulnerability(i.e being yourself without fear of others) can be seen as a part of hesitation. I must remember that failing so many time made me like this, but it was something I always wanted. Being deliberate of not hiding emotions and desires from others.
Examples of being vulnerable:
1. Asking someone on a date openly
2. Not being afraid to offend someone, assuming you are not being an ass.
3. Admit what you lack.
4. Take responsibility
5. Tell people they are being hurtful
6. Tell people you admire/respect/love them.

Note:
* Vulnerability is not a tactic for some goal, it is for your own self. It is genuine, it has the why in it.
* Vulnerability is not emotional vomit. It is just not a happy thing.
