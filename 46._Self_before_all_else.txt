====== 46. Self before all else ======
Created Saturday 08 May 2021

=== Context ===
I was reading about Sharia on a website(just for fun, and was happy) having exit-door for Muslims.
For a second, I succumed to the rule, and found myself accepting death. This caused a lot of trouble. I looked up in my values, and found no sense of self preservation.
So I thought of adding this value.

=== Why ===
Primarily because rules are nothing to a dead person.
And a person who deprecates himself(worst case accepts injustice) loses out on a definition of happiness.
* Rigorously speaking, a person who loses out on happiness cannot make others happy. Consequently, behavior(self or others) is hampered.
* üò≠Ô∏è [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1lnxUXWGgE|Girl risking her life to live properly]]
* I want everyone to have their self as priority - this makes us be the best to others and save us from stupid myths.

=== How ===
Just remember that you are the most important person, and that you make decisions. Maybe, for some cause, I'm ready to die, but it'll be a deliberate decision, not something done out of fear/helplessness/stupidity.

=== Conclusion ===
Self is the most important thing. Preserve it no matter what.
