====== 18. Check if an idea is stupid or not ======
Created Thursday 25 February 2021

Ideas are termed as stupid because:
1. They are too pedantic
2. They are impractical
3. They are irrelevant
4. They won't make visible changes
5. They cannot be used in a business
6. There are better things that can be done

Many of these "reasons" are stemmed in bias and pessimism.

Goal - To find out if an idea is really bad. Or is it a gold mine. FIXME

Solution:
* Test the source of reason, if it is unfounded, Sagan standard is applicable.
* Take examples of many popular/(just failed) products and see what went wrong. Do this in a amenable way.
* Use the web to generate ideas and find data, and avoid biases in google search.
* Do 'Wizard of Oz' experiment
* Find out tentative criteria about what is important. If it looks connected to many things maybe the criteria is universal.
Check HCI slides to see how pessimism will end things.
