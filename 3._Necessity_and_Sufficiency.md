# 3. Necessity and Sufficiency
Created Wednesday 27 January 2021

I found a major assumption in me that was wrong.
| Necessity  | Sufficiency |      Possible in reality       |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------------------------:|
| Inexistent | Inexistent  | Yes - completely new phenomena |
| Inexistent |   Exists    |     Yes, but I thought no      |
|   Exists   | Inexistent  |              Yes               |
|   Exists   |   Exists    |              Yes               |


The problem is with (0, 1) is that it is actually data insufficiency or plain old reductionism.

#### How will this help

* Well this will increase things that I look at positively, i.e it will lower consideration potential.
* I have to remember that this is not a guarantee, but that it is possible.
* It can explain why somethings which I deem necessary may actually be incomplete. And the fact that this is possible will provide plausability in things that do work.
