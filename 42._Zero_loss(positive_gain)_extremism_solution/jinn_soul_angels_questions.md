# Q1: How to accommodate the jinns, should they be considered separate from the science?
    Answer: Hypothesis: Science is the knowledge of the universe, it applies to everything.
    i. This ensures that there are no superstitions.
    ii. It also ensures that the jinn are not required to be studied separately, studying the natural things is enough.
    What if someone studies them separately:
    i. There will be no creativity or experiments, as he will follow the books(Quran and Hadith), which is easily misinterpretable and cannot be trusted.
    ii. It will be considered unscientific because scientific integrity is hindered. And research will not be accepted.
    iii. Studying them will be like studying a very small thing, and will be unverifiable.
# Q2: Should we consider angels, as solely responsible for natural events?
    Answer: There are two questions here:
        1. Freewill of angels
        2. Mechanism of angels
        Angels - have no freewill (established in the Quran)
        Also, this would mean that there are no laws followed by nature, it is random.
        Refutation: Newton clearly showed that this is not the case, and the evidence of Physics found so far helps, we have found many
        occurrences of previously unexplainable facts, which are clearly explained by mathematics.

        Disadvantage: Believing in angels also leads to superstition and loss of action.
        3. If the angels are really controlling our world, who is controlling them, what is their goal. And what laws do they follow.
        Proof by contradiction:
            Angels change the world? The question is who controls the environment for the angels, say it is some agent B.
            Now B also has an operating environment, this means B also has a controller. This leads to an infinite regression.
            Such a regression is not possible with living creatures, because they need components themselves.

            This contradiction has occurred due to our assumptions that angels control the universe. They do not.
            This also proves why non-living things are means to achieve a system.
            Atoms are non-living.

            Doubt: Maybe it is true that angels control the world, and are made of atoms.
                Such a thing is easily synonymous with the 'Gods' of things, as common with the Greeks, and various polytheistic religions.
                Major Disadvantage
                    i. It definitely will stop innovation and stop us from looking up the cause of things. And thus make us less intelligent.
                    ii. People will try to look for what controls the angels. And study that.
                Behavioral problems:
                    i. We are not dependent on some beings, in fact nobody is.
                    ii. Science just stops being the judge, and hence, loses its credibility.
        A good thought: None of the major scientific theories aim for Angels or the likes, and seem to very accurately predict nature.
