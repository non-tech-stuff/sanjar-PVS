# 16. Importance of Scientific attitude
Created Friday 19 February 2021


1. In these days of conflict between ancient and modern studies; there must surely be something to be said for a study which did not begin with Pythagoras and will not end with Einstein; but is the oldest and the youngest. – **G.H. HARDY**
2. Mathematics is the indispensable instrument of all physical research. – **BERTHELOT**
3. A mathematician knows how to solve a problem, he can not solve it. – **MILNE**
4. Analysis and natural philosophy owe their most important discoveries to this fruitful means, which is called induction. Newton was indebted to it for his theorem of the binomial and the principle of universal gravity. – **LAPLACE**
5. Mathematics is the Queen of Sciences and Arithmetic is the Queen of Mathematics. – **GAUSS**
6. Mathematics is the art of saying many things in many different ways. – **MAXWELL**
7. Every body of discovery is mathematical in form because there is no other guidance we can have. – **DARWIN**
8. Mathematics is a most exact science and its conclusions are capable of absolute proofs. – **C.P. STEINMETZ**
9. Natural numbers are the product of human spirit. – **DEDEKIND**
10. Geometry, as a logical system, is a means and even the most powerful means to make children feel the strength of the human spirit that is of their own spirit. – **H. FREUDENTHAL**
11. Let the relation of knowledge to real life be very visible to your pupils and let them understand how by knowledge the world could be transformed. – **BERTRAND RUSSELL**
12. Mathematics is both the queen and the hand-maiden of all sciences – **E.T. BELL**
13. With the Calculus as a key, Mathematics can be successfully applied to the explanation of the course of Nature – **WHITEHEAD**
14. There are few things which we know which are not capable of mathematical reasoning and when these can not, it is a sign that our knowledge of them is very small and confused and where a mathematical reasoning can be had, it is as great a folly to make use of another, as to grope for a thing in the dark when you have a candle stick standing by you. – **ARTHENBOT**
15. “Statistics may be rightly called the science of averages and their estimates.” – **A.L.BOWLEY & A.L.BODDINGTON**
16. Where a mathematical reasoning can be had, it is as great a folly to make use of any other, as to grope for a thing in the dark, when you have a candle in your hand. – **JOHN ARBUTHNOT**


#### Class XII part 1

1. There is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics ... . It may be very hard to define mathematical beauty but that is just as true of beauty of any kind, we may not know quite what we mean by a beautiful poem, but that does not prevent us from recognising one when we read it. – **G. H. HARDY**
2. Mathematics, in general, is fundamentally the science of self-evident things. – **FELIX KLEIN**
3. The essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom. – ** CANTOR**
4. All Mathematical truths are relative and conditional. – **C.P. STEINMETZ**
5. "The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.” – **ALBERT EINSTEIN**
6. With the Calculus as a key, Mathematics can be successfully applied to the explanation of the course of Nature.” – **WHITEHEAD**


#### Class XII part 2

7. Just as a mountaineer climbs a mountain – because it is there, so a good mathematics student studies new material because it is there. – **JAMES B. BRISTOL**
8. One should study Mathematics because it is only through Mathematics that nature can be conceived in harmonious form. – **BIRKHOFF**
9. He who seeks for methods without having a definite problem in mind seeks for the most part in vain. – **D. HILBERT**
10. In most sciences one generation tears down what another has built and what one has established another undoes. In Mathematics alone each generation builds a new story to the old structure. – **HERMAN HANKEL**
11. The moving power of mathematical invention is not reasoning but imagination. – **A.DE-MORGAN**
12. The mathematical experience of the student is incomplete if he never had the opportunity to solve a problem invented by himself. – **G. POLYA**
13. The theory of probabilities is simply the Science of logic quantitatively treated. – **C.S. PEIRCE**
