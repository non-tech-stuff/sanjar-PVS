====== 31. Opinions and Arguments ======
Created Wednesday 14 April 2021

FIXME: it is very important to have opinions and arguments, based on knowledge and experience.
* You may not know everything, but this fact doesn't help in getting knowledge. Because you need to challenge sources rigorously.
* If you cannot form/hold on to the opinions and arguments you've gathered from your experience, then having that experience is useless.
* You should know if you're sure of a thing. Atleast, you should know how you are.
* Deallocate stupid information, tag it and discard. Do this fiercely. Every wrong information decreases quality of life.
* Contempt won't help, thinking straight will.
* Always, always, hold your ground - ask, question, think before accepting an idea that seems off.
Complete this stub.
* Accepting things is neither good-behavior, nor is it honest. You should not accept wrong things.
Why I am doing this:
People can fool, be fooled. Remember how long it took you to learn and accept freedom.
* Always stick to your values.
* Learn selective dellocation of false facts, people may err sometimes. It may/maynot be their fault. It may be intentional.
* Don't lose your sense of thinking. Preserve it at all costs.
* Ignore false things, remember that you are happy no matter what.
Activity - try to strengthen this facet by interacting with people.
Important - never think you "should not use things for comfort, it's better" - it is not. You should use familiarity of a place/thing as cushion.
Conclusion: You must be happy at all cost. Your PTSD about acceptance and "being-good" should not hamper it.
--------------------
Trick - assume there are many of your previous versions with yourself, this way you won't feel scared. If you are wrong, you understand. This method decreases both defense, fear and getting locked down. Note: Be yourself alone, your other selves are independent people, but you know them pretty well. You can trust them. Caution - is this method wrong - I don't think so, this method is just a way to make a situation friendly. That always helps. Experiment with this. **This is only for cases where your opinions are challenged.**
