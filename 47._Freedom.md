# 47. Freedom
Created Thursday 13 May 2021

TODO: 'Freedom' as an asbolutely free infinite action membrane, without the contradictions with other agents. Formalize it, and investigate.

Note: don't copy systems, prove them. [Make your own system](https://youtu.be/0hLjuVyIIrs?t=567)
Freedom is not free, we need to keep working.
