# 19. Thinking and practicality
Created Saturday 27 February 2021

#### Practicality
I don't have anything against practicality. I just fear that I'll use it as a sink for ending all thinking and inquiry about things.

#### Situation

* From my childhood, I had an attitude that anything(that is conceivable) is possible.
* Then I learnt Math and Science.
* I went about getting ideas from people.
* Then I started fearing if Math and Science were practical ways of thinking.
* In fact, even now, I cannot think anything except in a first-principle way.



* It is a great cause of anxiety when my peers can do things without thinking and I cannot. I fear that this will happen forever, and I'll get nowhere.
* I want to get rid of this fear.
* I accept that I've collected a lot of biases in my brain, but I still believe that all this information is tractable, using some method.


#### Things I'll lose if I stop studying and/or thinking

* I'll lose myself in the process of concentrating on answers.
* I'll lose my curiosity.
* I'll give up on thinking: I'll accept that the world is really a stupid place, where some things are just not possible.
* Undervaluing things will make life boring for me.
* I'll lose empathy and understanding.
* People trying to disprove possibilities to just prove their beliefs right will stop original thinking.
* I'll lose happiness.
* Stupid ideas presented as facts/wisdom.
* Wasting my time in useless arguments, which I just don't want to talk about.


#### Things I am willing to give up

* Respect or recognition of what I do.
* Me being smart/practical.
* Money, assuming I am able to live properly comfortably. I love money, because it helps me pursue what I like.


I tried to come up with non-constructive proofs, but I have not been able to prove that thinking and study is better.
So I looked for constructive proofs.

Here are some things that might help:

* [./Intelligence is sexy but impractical _ by Thomas Vato _ Medium-compressed.pdf](./19._Thinking_and_practicality/Intelligence is sexy but impractical _ by Thomas Vato _ Medium-compressed.pdf)


#### Conclusion

* I accept that "pursuit of knowledge" is far more important that knowledge.
* I accept that thinking has brought where me where I am, and shall take me forward.
* I am happy to realize that I can asynchronously think and apply known knowledge.
* I shall not stop myself from thinking, and shall not think of myself as being stupid.
* I accept that I am responsible for any harm that happens from this. No regrets.
