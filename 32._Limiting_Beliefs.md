# 32. Limiting Beliefs
Created Thursday 15 April 2021

TODO: this is a stub.
I have the following limiting beliefs:

1. I can't  make projects or apps of my own.
2. I can't work at a big tech company
3. I can't get a Masters because my marks are bad
4. I can't go to a foreign university because my marks are low, I am socially awkward.
5. I can't be in a relationship with a "good" girl - beautiful, successful, socially good.


Get rid of this, there's no minimum criteria for success. You start by believing.
Note: Rana started with 100 videos, I would have given up. Because I would ignore the need and my wish. This is stupid. Failing is OK. It should not be because of us.
