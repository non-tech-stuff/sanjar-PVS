====== 10. Action as the only choice ======
Created Tuesday 09 February 2021

=== Context ===
* I sometimes get scared and anxious because of stupid doomsayers - AI is our enemy, genetic crops are bad, tech makes us dumb etc. Topics may even be labeled impossible.
* This way, my excitement is decreased. It becomes very hard for me to be happy, because I love tech. It feels like I'm doing a bad thing.
* Also, I get fearful as to what would have happened if people just confirmed to society/peer pressure. We'd have a very bad quality of life. It is unacceptable.

Now, the simple solution is to just ignore these people, and keep learning. Because they generally don't have enough knowledge on the subject.
I do this. But the nagging dampens my passion.

* Actually I've had something similar before - concept of Apocalypse in major religions.
* It is also very depressing.

=== My itch ===
I wanted to get at this problem once and for all, so that I don't have to decide if "something is good" before I study/learn it. Because it's a huge waste of time.
I just want to study it.

=== Problem ===
* Things can of course have risks, but I don't think risk evaluation can be done with a negative(leave it) mindset. It is is just too costly and depressing.
* In fact, I'd consider it dishonest.
* I'm talking about evaluation of real concepts/hypotheses/theories here, not myths and fables.

=== Solution ===
**Answer: Always be ambitious.**
Let the knowledge(valid knowledge) [[humans|we]] currently have be K_{p}(present).
K_{p} is updated by perturbations, which happen in two ways:
* Innovations, ambition
* May happen accidently(e.g. discovery of tsunamis, invention of telephone).
Note: Either way, we need to be cognizant.

Now, suppose there exists some knowledge element(i.e. some topic) //D//, such that if we access(learn) //D//, we are doomed. This is the doomsayers 'event', something which we are //not// //supposed// to //pursue//.

Now, as we are working everyday - we are getting closer to //D//, and not away from it, because concepts are generally linked together. Also, we have no idea how //D// might be accessed from the present state(K_{p}). To defer D, three approaches are possible:
1. Do nothing - never reach D. Unacceptable.
2. Do things in a constrained manner - encroaches freedom of inquiry. Also, there's no guarantee when //D// will be reached.
3. Do things in an unconstrained, fast way - this is the only option. This is exiting, and if //D// hits, we'll have the most amount of knowledge to avert it.

Note: D may be known, or unknown.

=== Conclusion ===
Be curious and innovate!
