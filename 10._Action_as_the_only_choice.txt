====== 10. Action as the only choice ======
Created Tuesday 09 February 2021

=== Context ===
* I sometimes get scared and anxious because of stupid doomsayers - AI is our enemy, genetic crops are bad, tech makes us dumb etc. Topics may even be labeled impossible.
* This way, my excitement is decreased. It becomes very hard for me to be happy, because I love tech. It feels like I'm doing a bad thing.
* Also, I get fearful as to what would have happened if people just confirmed to society/peer pressure. We'd have a very bad quality of life. It is unacceptable.

Now, the simple solution is to just ignore these people, and keep learning. Which is exactly what I do? But the nagging dampens my passion.

=== My itch ===
I wanted to get at this problem once and for all, so that I don't have to decide if "something is good" before I study/learn it. Because it's a huge waste of time.

=== Problem ===
* Things can of course have risks, but I don't think risk evaluation can be done with a negative(leave it) mindset. It is is just too costly and depressing.
* In fact, I'd consider it dishonest.
* I'm talking about evaluation of real concepts/hypotheses/theories here, not myths and fables.

=== Solution ===
