====== 32. Limiting Beliefs ======
Created Thursday 15 April 2021

TODO: this is a stub.
I have the following limiting beliefs:
1. I can't  make projects or apps of my own.
2. I can't work at a big tech company
3. I can't get a Masters because my marks are bad
4. I can't go to a foreign university because my marks are low, I am socially awkward.

Get rid of this, there's no minimum criteria for success. You start by believing.
