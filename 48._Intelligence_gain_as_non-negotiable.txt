====== 48. Intelligence gain as non-negotiable ======
Created Wednesday 19 May 2021

Of course, this includes knowledge.

=== Challenges(which actually anchor intelligence): ===
* **Fun/Calm** - follow your mood. Easily follow my "Model". Do if fun.(but try to prime yourself maturely). Ignore beliefs/information/biases are handled properly. **Also, I'm not hesitant, so I aim(goal) like crazy(after proving its rigor).**
* **Emotions** - fighting nature, R in HRF only makes me intelligent and motivated.
* **Honesty** - obvious for a bootstrapped endeavor, I want everyone to have knowledge for free(because I'm bootstrapped). This helps people, that includes me. Big advantage - people generate a plethora of ideas, new use-cases - huge gain of intelligence. **Optimize ruthlessly - don't waste money/resources, automate except on projects.**
* **Money** - need an amount that's enough for a comfortable life and bootstraps the endeavor. How: Use business models to bootstrap the process, build a product that depends on the concept, pitch to investors. If completely failed - no money is lost(investor sponsored your endeavor!). The goal is to succeed - most failures encountered, most intelligence again.** Pursuing money for discovering powerful economic models is a worthwhile effort, though.**

All in all intelligence(with honesty) makes the world just and happy. And it makes us more intelligent. Win-win situation, also helps in discovering win-win scenarios.

=== Effects ===
* Have fun.
* Good communication, brings people together.
* Decreases work time, increases number of problems solved.
* Good behavior, less poverty mindset.

Note: There are 8 types of intelligences, for humans, AFAIR.
