# 24. HRF - three params
Created Thursday 01 April 2021

#### The params
I've played with three quantities about the experience of my life. You should do, pursue something only if **ALL** the below criteria are met.

1. Happiness - Are you happy doing this? How do you feel? Is freedom at stake? Other beliefs and values.
2. Rigor/Rationality - Thinking rationally, and confidently.
3. Frankness - Are you open to new ideas. Are you comfortable with strong but open ends of a knowlege - i.e. You should be curious about inner workings even if you know the abstractions - it shouldn't make you worrisome. Values that I hold dear.


Note: I posit that they converge to a good life. But that remains to be tested.

#### Things gained

1. Happiness - increases confidence, eliminates self-deprecation, eliminates artifical terrors like 'Hell'/'Evil' etc, prejudices, learned helplessness, gaslighting, innovation, going against the "norm", perseverance, avoids paranoid need-justification(increases passion in our goals) to others.
2. Rigor - Helps in formulating ideas, testing them, being truthful, patience, honesty.
3. Frankness - makes us ambitious, removes need for complacency of any party(side or idea), solves arrogance, improved communication, empathy, improve democratization of knowledge, deep understanding of a thing.


#### Things lost
A little time and energy for evaluation, which is worth it.

FIXME: Evaluate this in various "problems" that you've had.
