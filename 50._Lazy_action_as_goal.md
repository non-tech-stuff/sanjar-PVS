# 50. Lazy action as goal
Created Monday 06 September 2021


* Action on failure/discomfort. Until then, everything is right.


#### Applications

* Don't worry about details of an action, lazy action with what I am thinking now, details will come later. They are important, but that doesn't mean they need to be thought of before. **This is important and should be kept in mind. **Why this works - well idk. Gets rid of the *installation/uninstallation/automation_first* mentality.
